Born in the Philippines and migrated to Australia 2009. I speak English and tagalog. I have been studying most of my life with all sorts of health care. I work as a childcare worker for 3 years and now full time working as an Assistant in Nursing. I'm a gamer and most of my time I play games just to kill time or to relieve stress.
